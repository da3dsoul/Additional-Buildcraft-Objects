For recipes: I made some pictures, but it's best to use NEI.

## License

This is originally by Flow86, but I have at this point rewritten the entire mod.

My license is: unless you are Flow86 or you have made major contributions, don't say it is yours. Other than that, I don't care. If I see it, I'd like to at least see a shoutout in at least 4pt font. If you download it, make sure you trust the source.
If you post an error and you didn't get it here, the first response if given at all will be to first re-download from me. Assuming this condition is met, I usually respond and fix bugs in a timely manner.

## JProfiler 
JProfiler's creator, ej-technologies, has been kind and provided me with an open-source license to help make everything I do for these little projects better. Shout out to them! Their stuff is expensive, but repeatedly saving 4 hours of a programmer's time pays for it in no time.
Here's an obligatory but much deserved link: [JProfiler Overview](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html)


## Items

#### Windmills

* Recipe:

![StoneTransportPipe Gravel](recipes/windmill.png)
      
* Placement rules:
Must be placed on 2 fence posts (or nether fence).
Must not have any opaque blocks within 2 blocks at its height or 1 below.
Can NOT push energy to the east (over the blades, they don't rotate).

Windmill energy rules are grouped into two sections: Plains and Hills.

Windmills gain two types of boosts: Biome and Height.

**Plains Rules:**
If a windmill is placed in a biome with low height variation (flat), it
will follow the Plains rule set.

* Biome:
Windmills gain a bonus for simply being placed in the plains section,
the amount of bonus depends on the biome. Flatter is better.

* Height:
Windmills placed as close as possible to sea level will provide the
maximum height boost. Sea level assumed 64 -> + 2 for fence posts -> the
windmill block should be at 66.

**Hills Rules:**

* Biome:
Windmills gain no bonus from biome placement in hills, but can make up
for it and still achieve maximum output with Height.

* Height:
The higher a windmill is placed in hills, the greater the bonus, capping
at a height of 124 meters.

All windmills gain an extra a boost in the rain.

The maximum output for windmills is 13.75 RF/t without rain and 15 RF/t
with rain.

### Ender Storage
Simply an Ender Chest for Buildcraft. Adding an insertion pipe to an
ender chest allows putting items in it. Right-clicking on the insertion
pipe when connected opens the BC Ender Chest for ease of use and
debugging purposes, for that "where'd all my items go?" moment.

* Insertion:
The Insertion Pipe will choose to add items to the ender
chest before anything else. If you don't like that, don't put an ender
chest next to an insertion pipe. It is the only pipe that will connect
to them now.

* Ender Extraction Pipe
   * Recipe:
   ![StoneTransportPipe Gravel](recipes/EnderExtraction.png)
      \*The Pipe is an Extraction Pipe
* Usage:
Stole/borrowed the gui from the emerald pipe in buildcraft, along with
all the logic and everything but the item extraction, which only pulls
from the ender storage. I doubt BC will sue me, and they can have it. I
just wanted a way to transport items 6000 blocks without making all that
pipe and then keeping it loaded. Yes, this works across dimensions.

Power it with an engine, it'll extract just like an emerald but connects to an ender chest.

## Pipes

#### Division Pipe
   Splits stacks into a specified size 1-8, incremented with a wrench. If 
   the stack has a remainder, the moving item will be reversed.

#### Round Robin Transport Pipe
   Each itemstack moving through the pipe will output to each connected pipe in order. Use with a division pipe to ensure equal distribution.

   * Recipe:

      ![StoneTransportPipe Gravel](recipes/RoundRobinTransportPipe.png)


#### Insertion Transport Pipe
   Insertion Pipes will always try to add an item to an attached inventory. The items will continue through the pipes if they fail to be inserted.

   This pipe is very useful for feedback loops as it forces the item to go in
   to the last machine if it can.

   * Recipe:

      ![IronTransportPipe CactusGreen](recipes/InsertionTransportPipe.png)

#### Fluid Insertion Pipe
   Same as insertion pipe but for fluids. With the way the fluid system is set up in Buildcraft, the fluids will distribute equally to all attached tank blocks.

   * Recipe:

      ![IronTransportPipe CactusGreen](recipes/FluidInsertion.png)


#### Extraction Transport Pipe
   Extraction Pipe is the opposite of the Insertion Pipe. If the pipe can choose
   between an inventory and another pipe the pipe will always go with the next
   pipe. Also this pipe behaves the same as a wood pipe where it will pull items
   out of an inventory if the pipe has an active redstone engine applied to it.

   This pipe is useful for tight spaces where you do not want a pipe to
   accidentally fill a chest or machine.

   * Recipe:

      ![WoodTransportPipe Planks](recipes/ExtractionTransportPipe.png)


#### Crossover Transport Pipe
   This pipe will direct material entering it to the pipe
   (or something accepting material, like chests) directly across from it.
   If no such pipe exists, a random direction is chosen.

   * Recipe:

      ![StoneTransportPipe IronTransportPipe](recipes/CrossoverTransportPipe.png)


#### Compactor Transport Pipe
   Combines items(tacks) to larger itemstacks (currently to itemstacks >= 16 items)

   can be toggled/switched with gates and Redstone

   * Recipe:

      ![StoneTransportPipe Piston](recipes/CompactorTransportPipe.png)



#### Valve Pipe
   acts like a (golden) wooden pipe (without need of wooden engine)
   <br>
   can be toggled/switched by gates and Redstone
   
   **can empty a full tank with enough (=full) pressure for two golden pipes in seconds!**
   
   Pressure behavior: Will empty down to half of tank valve pipe is connected to or entire tank if placed on bottom tank.
   
   Config option to disable pressure behavior.

   * Recipe:

      ![WoodenWaterproofPipe BasicGate](recipes/valve.png)



#### Golden Iron Fluid Pipe
   acts like an iron pipe with speed of a golden pipe

   * Recipe:

      ![GoldenWaterproofPipe IronWaterproofPipe](recipes/GoldenIronWaterproofPipe.png)



#### Balancing Fluid Pipe
   balances liquid of connected tanks

   Thanks to Oxygene13 for his idea.

   * Recipe:

      ![WoodenWaterproofPipe RedstoneEngine WoodenWaterproofPipe](recipes/BalancingWaterproofPipe.png)

#### Kinesis Switch Pipe
   acts as lever for power pipes
   
   can be toggled/switched by gates and Redstone

   * Recipe:

      ![GoldenKinesisPipe Lever](recipes/PowerSwitchPipe.png)

#### Diode Kinesis Pipe
   acts as a diode/iron pipe for kinesis pipes

   * Recipe:

      ![GoldenKinesisPipe IronANDGate](recipes/Diode.png)

#### Distribution Kinesis Pipe
   acts as a power distributor - every filter line which has an item in it is 
   "open" to receive power

   * Recipe:

      ![DiamondTransportPipe DirectedKinesisPipe](recipes/DistributionKinesisPipe.png)

## Actions

#### Switch On Pipe
   activates the pipe as long as the action is active
   (On/Off via Signal)
   
   a pipe toggled "on" will be set to off if switch-on is deactivated 
   
#### Toggle On Pipe
   activates the pipe and keeps it activated until a ToggleOff/SwitchOn occurs
   (On via Signal)
   
#### Toggle Off Pipe
   deactivates the pipe
   (Off via Signal)
